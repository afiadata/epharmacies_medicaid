Data for: "The good, the bad, and the ugly: Compliance of e-pharmacies serving India and Kenya with regulatory requirements and best practices"
Persistent Identifier
10.17037/DATA.00004475

Description
The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics and business practices of e-pharmacies, and their compliance with global best practice guidelines and national regulatory requirements

Study staff reviewed the websites and apps of all e-pharmacies serving retail customers in two Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs): (1) India, which has a very large e-pharmacy market, but is yet to enact formal e-pharmacy regulations, and (2) Kenya, which has a smaller market, but with developed regulations. All data used in this analysis was available in the public domain at the time of data collection.

The overarching project of which this analysis was part received approval by the ethics committees of The George Institute for Global Health (Project number: 26/2022), Strathmore University Business School (Ref. no: SU-ISERC1475/22), and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (Ref. no: 28055).
